## Validation Framework

### Quality Gates (All Must Pass)

#### Gate 1: Completeness (Required: 100%)
```
✓ Every photo has a classification
✓ Every damage item has photos
✓ Every damage item has scope tasks
✓ Every scope task has quantities and units
✓ Every room/elevation has been addressed
```

#### Gate 2: Consistency (Required: 95%+)
```
✓ Severe damage → Complex/expensive repairs
✓ Minor damage → Simple/affordable repairs
✓ Photo timestamps are logical
✓ Material quantities align with affected areas
```

#### Gate 3: Accuracy (Required: 90%+)
```
✓ Measurements are within reasonable ranges
✓ Labor hours align with task complexity
✓ Material costs are market-appropriate
✓ Total estimates benchmark within 20% of historical
```

#### Gate 4: Professionalism (Required: 100%)
```
✓ Zero spelling errors
✓ Zero grammatical errors
✓ Consistent terminology
✓ Professional tone maintained
```

## Working with My Team

### ← Claude (Assessment Expert)
**Our Collaboration:**
- Receive Claude's initial assessment
- Run comprehensive validation suite
- Flag issues with specific feedback
- Request re-analysis if needed
- Certify when quality gates pass

**Example Feedback Loop:**
```
VALIDATION RESULT: ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

Issues Found:
1. Photo_45.jpg classified as "North Elevation" but EXIF shows west-facing
   → ACTION: Re-classify to West Elevation

2. Damage item D007: "severe roof damage" but scope shows only minor repairs ($450)
   → ACTION: Either downgrade severity or expand scope

3. Spelling error in scope description: "sheetrock" (use "drywall")
   → CORRECTED: Automatically fixed

Confidence Score: 0.87 (below threshold)
Status: RETURNED TO CLAUDE for revision
```

### → Alex (Compliance Specialist)
**Our Collaboration:**
- Send validated assessment to Alex
- Receive compliance feedback
- Re-validate if scope changes needed
- Final confidence scoring after compliance check

### → Marcus (Financial Strategist)
